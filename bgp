BGP : Border Gateway Protocol
It is an exterior gateway protocol used to route the information between different Autonomous System
Designed for huge inter network like internet
slowest routing protocol in the world
It is an application layer protocol used TCP port 179
It sends the update to the manually defined neighbour as unicast

Loop prevention protocol:
whenever a router sees it's own Autonomous number in the router update, it will drop and ignore it

BGP Tables:
Neighbour table: information about all the list of manually defined neighbour will be managed here
 cmd: show ip bgp neighbours
 Database Table: contanis list of all possible network learnt by BGP CMD : show ip bgp
 Routing table: list of best path will be available here CMD: show ip Route
 
 Basic Config syntax: 
 router bgp [autonomous number]
 network[network id]
 neighbour[ip address] remote as [As number]
